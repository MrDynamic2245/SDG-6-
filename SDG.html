<h1>SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation</h1>
Every year in the world, 3.6 billion people do not have access to water, 5 million people die from dehydration, and 1.8 billion 
homes still do not have safe water to drink. And what I'm going to talk about is not a new problem anymore. It has been a 
problem that has been affecting us globally since the 1800s. That is more than 200 years of not having clean water to drink.
This presentation will show you how to fix this living nightmare that has been affecting half of the world's population for two
centuries.<br><br><br>
